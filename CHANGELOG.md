# Changelog

All notable changes to bluray-to-mp4. Dates are America/Chicago.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- **Complete UI overhaul.** The desktop app now uses a real design system
  (theme.py, dark/light palettes) with sidebar navigation, cards, browse-
  for-folder, live output-filename previews, per-episode editable titles,
  and a History page. All colors come from the palette; nothing hardcodes
  them (light mode works by switching the palette).
- **Encoding pipeline improvements:** per-stage ETA shown in the UI
  (elapsed-based ffmpeg estimate), cancel button stops ffmpeg gracefully,
  overall queue progress + per-job progress bars.
- **Bundled ffmpeg/ffprobe** in CI builds (downloaded from ffmpeg.org at
  build time, placed in packaging/tools, found automatically by the
  discovery layer). One less manual install step.
- **Status pill** in the header shows monitor state (LAN URL when on).

### Fixed

- The frozen-exe entry now passes the binary name through correctly (the
  previous version incorrectly included it inside the args list).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **LAN monitoring on by default** with an in-app on/off toggle. Since this
  is a private repository, the read-only status server ships enabled so
  another machine can check rip progress with zero manual configuration;
  the checkbox starts/stops the server live and persists the choice.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **TMDB episode-title and movie-year autofill** (issue #6, optional).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- **"makemkvcon not found on PATH"** on healthy machines: installers don't add
  CLI tools to PATH, so tools are now discovered via env override -> PATH ->
  standard install folders (Program Files, LOCALAPPDATA, WinGet links).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-01

Initial release. Complete local disc-to-MP4 pipeline.
